Basically most of Internet friends are gay (we all kind of realised together) and then about 70% of all of the close friends I've ever had in my life are LGBT+. Pretty wild considering I went to a Catholic high school. It wouldnt surprise me if a third of the girls on the club soccer team I was on in high school have come out now. Funny how the world works.,0,train

"Convenient that the title won't say the actual number, which is 2019 assaults. Considering there live 6.5 million Immigrants in Germany, this makes extremely likely that the sex offenders were immigrants. The chance of an Muslim being a sexual assaultant the highest of them all, given how corrupted they all are. But still both numbers are so incredibly hard that they constitute  a reason to deport all 6.5 million immigrants back to their home countries, where they rightly belong.",1,dev

"I agree. My view is that they just have the right to be dumb as long as they don't bother me. Whilst I think it's a disorder as long as they don't hurt any body else it's their decision to seek help. To me it would be like trying to claim I'm biologically a dog. I'm not and my genetics say so just like my gender. And if anybody tries to say that gender is defined by the society, they're just further proving that they're delusional since our society's definition of gender is you biological sex. So according to their own definition gender means sex.",1,train
"The truth is that its only moral for lgbt people to not want their brothers and sisters to reproduce. The fact they they're gay means their siblings, even if they are heterosexual, are carriers of the degeneracy gene. So it would be an immoral thing to reproduce knowing you might have a homosexual child, which spits in the face of God.",1,train

"Women often look for good provider men for commitment and financial stability after dating jerks, engaging in promiscuity, and having children they want provided for. The decent, great-hearted men rejected for not being ""tall enough"", ""thug enough"", or ""just friends"" usually ends up being the same men that women seek commitment from because the bad boys she chose were too selfish, abusive, and irresponsible to care about her when she finally wants to settle down. Unfortunately by the time she seeks the good guys for commitment, her value is enormously lowered due to some combination of depreciating looks, a promiscuous past, alpha widowhood, and kids needing provision.",1,train

"Since my first girlfriend I had about 4 years ago, I have pulled about 15 other girls, and every single time, even though they are attractive, my dick doesn't want to work. It usually goes like this: we go to my room, we kiss, i escalate, yada yada, then when it comes time to actually fuck my dick stays soft. They usually try to suck it and get it erect but that doesn't work either. And if it does get hard momentarily then it goes soft a minute later while we start fucking.",0,train
